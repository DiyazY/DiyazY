### Hi there 👋 My name is Diyaz!
I’m a passionate software engineer with a strong focus on web development. Beyond coding, I’m deeply interested in programming, architecture, design, art, and reading. In my free time, I enjoy diving into books, working on personal projects, and sharing insights through blogging. I thrive on learning new skills and collaborating with inspiring people. My greatest source of motivation is my amazing family, who continually support me and fuel my drive to create meaningful work.
